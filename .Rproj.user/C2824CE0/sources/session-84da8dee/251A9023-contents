\details{
Suppose you want to calculate the correlation coefficient between two variables controlling for the effect of (or conditioning on) one or more other variables. So you cant to calculate \eqn{\hat{\rho}\left(X,Y|{\bf Z}\right)}, where \eqn{\bf Z} is a matrix, since it does not have to be just one variable. Using the correlation matrix \eqn{R} we can do the following:
\deqn{
r_{X,Y|{\bf Z}}=
{
\begin{array}{cc}
\frac{R_{X,Y} - R_{X, {\bf Z}} R_{Y,{\bf Z}}}{
\sqrt{ \left(1 - R_{X,{\bf Z}}^2\right)^T \left(1 - R_{Y,{\bf Z}}^2\right) }} & \text{if} \ \ |{\bf Z}|=1 \\
-\frac{ {\bf A}_{1,2} }{ \sqrt{{\bf A}_{1,1}{\bf A}_{2,2}} } & \text{if} \ \ |{\bf Z}| > 1
\end{array}
}
}

The \eqn{R_{X,Y}} is the correlation between variables \eqn{X} and \eqn{Y}, \eqn{R_{X,{\bf Z}}} and \eqn{R_{Y,{\bf Z}}} denote the correlations between \eqn{X} & \eqn{\bf Z} and \eqn{Y} & \eqn{\bf Z}, \eqn{{\bf A}={\bf R}_{X,Y,{\bf Z}}^{-1}}, with \eqn{\bf A} denoting the correlation sub-matrix of variables \eqn{X, Y, {\bf Z}} and \eqn{A_{i,j}} denotes the element in the \eqn{i}-th row and \eqn{j}-th column of matrix \eqn{A}. The \eqn{|{\bf Z}|} denotes the cardinality of \eqn{\bf Z}, i.e. the number of variables.
