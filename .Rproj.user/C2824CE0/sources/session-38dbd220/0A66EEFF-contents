Hypothesis test for equality of two correlation coefficients
}

\description{
Hypothesis test for equality of two correlation coefficients.
}

\usage{
correls2.test(r1, r2, n1, n2, type = "pearson")
}

\arguments{
\item{r1}{
The value of the first correlation coefficient.
}
\item{r2}{
The value of the second correlation coefficient.
}
\item{n1}{
The sample size of the first sample from which the first correlation coefficient was computed.
}
\item{n2}{
The sample size of the second sample from which the first correlation coefficient was computed.
}
\item{type}{
The type of correlation coefficients, "pearson" or "spearman".
}
}

\details{
The test statistic for the hypothesis of equality of two correlation coefficients is the following:
\deqn{
Z=\frac{\hat{z}_1-\hat{z}_2}{\sqrt{1/\left(n1-3\right)+1/\left(n2-3\right)}},
}
where \eqn{\hat{z}_1} and \eqn{\hat{z}_2} denote the Fisher's transformation (see \code{\link{correl}} applied to the two correlation coefficients and \eqn{n_1} and \eqn{n_2} denote the  sample sizes of the two correlation coefficients. The denominator is the sum of the variances of the two coefficients and as you can see we used a different variance estimator than the one we used before. This function performs hypothesis testing for the equality of two correlation coefficients. The result is the calculated p-value from the standard normal distribution.

\value{
The partial correlation coefficient and the p-value for the test of no association.
